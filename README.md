Welcome to the Amazon Clone Landing Page! This is a simple and beginner-friendly project that replicates the layout of the Amazon homepage using only HTML and CSS. It is designed to provide a basic introduction to web development, focusing on layout and design.

**Note:** This landing page is not responsive, meaning it will not automatically adjust its layout for different screen sizes.

## Features

- **Simple Styling**: Uses basic CSS for layout styling such as colors, fonts, and positioning.
- **No JavaScript**: The project does not include any interactivity or JavaScript functionality. It focuses purely on the HTML and CSS structure.
